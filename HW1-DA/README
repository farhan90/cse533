Readme for the DistAlgo version

The main classes:

hw.da - the main launcher class, will setup everything
Master.da - the master class which handles all master's functions
Server.da - the server class to handle all the server duties
Client.da - the client class to handle all the client duties


INSTRUCTIONS:
To start the servers, clients and master do:
	dar -f hw.da <config filename>

We need to provide a config filename or the launcher will not start.
We decided to use a json file similar to our config file for NodeJS


BUGS AND LIMITATIONS:
- Bugs:
  - Do not support malformed config files

- Limitations:
	- DistAlgo does not support creation of processes in different
	nodes.


For language comparisons refer to the README for NodeJS
