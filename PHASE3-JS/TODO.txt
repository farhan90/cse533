1. When a node fails and a node is notified of it's new successor
 -> Have the node crash while sending the data to the new successor (i.e, the numberSent is set in such a way to crash the fucker while it was still sending to new successor)


2. When a node is joining, have it fail AND have it succeed


3. Test case for you are the only node, and some one joins AND joiner fails

4. Two nodes try to join at same time - joinging fails AND joinging succeeds!

5. Failure of Old Tail during joing:

6. Failure of both joining and old tail
